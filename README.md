# React E-Commerce Project (Deployed)

This is a web project built with React, showcasing my learning journey in frontend development, form validation, API integration, and state management. The project is currently deployed and can be accessed here: [Live Demo](https://resplendent-maamoul-b9b370.netlify.app/).

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a small e-commerce web app where users can:

- Log in with form validation handled by **Formik** and **Yup**
- Fetch and display products dynamically from an API
- Handle authentication tokens (`token`, `refreshToken`) and user ID
- Receive real-time notifications using **React-Toastify**

> Note: Initially, product data was static (from a local file), but I learned to fetch it dynamically via API calls.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

The project is **temporarily paused** due to difficulties with handling JWT tokens. I need to study more about authentication and token refresh before continuing.  

Even though I couldn't fully complete this project yet, I learned a lot about:

- Form validation with **Formik + Yup**
- Making API calls with **Axios** to render product data
- Managing tokens (JWT, refresh token) in the frontend
- Using **React-Toastify** for notifications

## üìö Learning Notes

This project helped me practice:

1. Validating login forms
2. Fetching product data via API instead of using static files
3. Handling authentication tokens and refreshing them
4. Displaying user feedback using toast notifications

Since I‚Äôm learning while building, progress was slow and I faced some challenges, so I paused the project to strengthen my knowledge first.

## üí° Future Plans

Once I have a better understanding of JWT authentication and token handling, I plan to:

- Fully implement secure login and token refresh
- Complete all API integrations
- Add more user interactions and animations
- Optimize the project for scalability
